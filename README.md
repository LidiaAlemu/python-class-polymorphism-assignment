# Python Class and Polymorphism Assignment

## Overview
This repository contains solutions for the "Design Your Own Class" and "Polymorphism Challenge" Python assignment.

## Assignment Activities

### Activity 1: Design Your Own Class
- Created a `Smartphone` class with attributes and methods.
- Created a `Smartwatch` subclass demonstrating inheritance and method overriding.
- Implemented example usage for both classes.

### Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge
- Created a base `Vehicle` class.
- Added `Car` and `Plane` subclasses with overridden `move()` methods.
- Demonstrated polymorphism by iterating through objects and calling the same method with different behaviors.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/python-class-polymorphism-assignment.git
